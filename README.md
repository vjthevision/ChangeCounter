# Adyen Kotlin Assignment

This repository contains the coding assignment for candidates applying for a Kotlin Engineer role at Adyen.
The goal of the assignment is to implement a cash register.

Criteria:
- The `CashRegister` gets initialized with some `Change`.
- When performing a transaction, it either returns a `Change` object or fails with a `TransactionException`.
- The `CashRegister` keeps track of the `Change` that's in it.

Bonus points:
- The cash register returns the minimal amount of change (i.e. the minimal amount of coins / bills).

Feel free to make any changes to the code in the assignment.
As part of the zip file you received is the local Git repository, you can use that to show us your development and thought process in the commit history.
